// We will represent blocks (the bricks and the paddle) as GE211
// `Rectangle`s. This is a struct that could be defined like so:
//
//     struct Rectangle
//     {
//         int x;  // x coordinate of left side
//         int y;  // y coordinate of top
//         int width;
//         int height;
//     };
using Block = ge211::Rectangle;

// This struct is used to represent the state of the ball. In particular, we
// need to know how big the ball is (radius_), whether it's moving or
// stopped (live_), where it is (center_), and where it's going (velocity_).
//
// Note that `velocity_` is a ge211::Dimensions, which means it has two
// `int` member variables, `width` and `height`, which are the rates of
// change in the x and y dimensions, respectively. In particular, in
// each "frame" `center_` gets shifted by `velocity_`. A `Dimensions`
// added to a `Position` yields a shifted `Position`, so this may be
// written as
//
//     a_ball.position_ += a_ball.velocity_;
//

    // Constructs a new ball. It needs to know where the paddle is (so it
    // can position itself right above it), and the geometry (which includes
    // the ball's radius and initial velocity). The ball starts dead--not
    // moving and positioned 1 pixel above the center of the paddle.
    //
    // In addition to constructing the ball in the model in the first place,
    // this can also be used to reset the ball by creating a new ball to
    // assign over it:
    //
    //     ball_ = Ball(paddle_, geometry_);

    // actually moving it.
