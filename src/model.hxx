// The model tracks the logical state of the game, independent of the
// presentation and control. In particular, it keeps track of:
//
//  - the game geometry (the sizes of things such as bricks, the paddle,
//    and the screen),
//
//  - the locations and sizes of all the bricks,
//
//  - the location and size of the paddle (the thing at the bottom that you
//    control), and
//
//  - the state of the ball, including its location and velocity (grouped in
//    the `Ball` struct).
//
// It also provides three member functions to help the UI in updating it.

    // The `= Geometry()` syntax makes the argument optional, in which case
    // it defaults to the default `Geometry`. That is, you can explicitly
    // create a `Geometry` to pass the `Model` constructor like so:
    //
    //     Geometry geo;
    //     geo.ball_radius = 2;
    //     Model model(geo);
    //
    // Or you can omit the constructor argument, in which case you get
    // the default `Geometry` (as defined in geometry.cpp):
    //
    //     Model model;
    //
    // The word `explicit` means that this constructor doesn't define an
    // implicit conversion whereby C++ would automatically convert
    // `Geometry`s into `Model`s if needed. You don't want that.

    // Updates the state of the game for one frame (usually 1/60 s).
    //
    // If the ball is dead then nothing happens. Otherwise there are
    // several possible cases, depending on the speculative next
    // position of the ball according to `Ball::next() const`. In
    // particular:
    //
    //  1. If the next position of the ball is off the bottom of the
    //     screen (according to Ball::hits_bottom(Geometry const&)),
    //     resets the ball to dead and returns.
    //
    //  2. If the next position of the ball would be off the top of
    //     the screen, reflects the velocity of the ball vertically.
    //
    //  3. If the next position of the ball would be off one side of
    //     the screen, reflects the velocity of the ball horizontally.
    //
    // (Note that cases 2 and 3 can both happen at the same time!)
    //
    //  4. If the next position of the ball destroys a brick (using
    //     Ball::destroy_bricks(std::vector<Block>&)) then it reflects
    //     the velocity of the ball both horizontally and vertically [1].
    //
    //  5. If the next position of the ball hits the paddle then it
    //     reflects vertical component of the ball's velocity and
    //     adds `boost` to the horizontal component [2].
    //
    // In all cases where the ball is still live (2–5), we then update
    // the ball to its next position for real.
    //
    // [1] Yes, this is weird physics.
    //
    // [2] This causes the effect where the velocity of the ball varies
    //     after each bounce off the paddle. While this adjustment is
    //     random, we require the UI component to perform the actual
    //     random number generation and pass the result to the model.
    //     This makes the model deterministic and thus easier to test.
